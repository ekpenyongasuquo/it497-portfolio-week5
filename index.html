    <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This portfolio documents my spiritual development,
        professional growth, ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout my
        studies at Ensign College. My goal is to integrate technical excellence with faith-based
        principles, ethical leadership, and service-oriented decision-making in preparation
        for a career in information technology.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership, and ethical decision-making rather than waiting to be compelled (Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28).</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, accountability, transparency, and ethical stewardship in all professional and technical work.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology as a tool to uplift others, reduce barriers, and create meaningful, people-centered solutions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="task1">
    <h2>Task 1 – Spiritual Portfolio Enhancement</h2>
    <h3>Christlike Attributes and Personal Warning Signs</h3>
    <p>
        My spiritual growth has been shaped by the principle of personal agency.
        Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose
        and responsibility. This principle has guided how I approach learning, leadership,
        and accountability in both academic and professional settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I reflected on my development, I identified personal warning signs that could
        hinder Christlike behavior, including impatience when projects move slowly and
        pride when technical solutions come easily. Recognizing these warning signs has
        allowed me to intentionally realign my behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        When impatience arises, I now slow my pace, listen actively, and refocus on service
        rather than efficiency. When pride appears, I deliberately seek feedback and
        collaboration to remain humble and teachable. These strategies directly influenced
        how I designed this portfolio—prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and user experience
        over technical complexity.
    </p>

<section id="task2">
    <h2>Task 2 – Professional Growth: Usability Testing & Design Enhancements</h2>

    <h3>Usability Testing Report</h3>
    <p>
        I conducted usability testing by reviewing my portfolio across multiple devices
        (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and inviting peer feedback. Testers reported difficulty
        locating key sections and noted readability issues related to contrast and layout density.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on this feedback, I implemented section anchors, simplified navigation,
        increased color contrast, added visual spacing, and ensured responsive design
        for smaller screens. These enhancements improved accessibility and reduced
        cognitive load for users.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemma Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        The ethical dilemma addressed involved balancing participant progress tracking
        with privacy and dignity. While data collection can improve instruction, excessive
        personal data compromises trust and agency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Guided by honesty, responsibility, transparency, and stewardship, I adopted an
        alternative approach using anonymized progress metrics and voluntary feedback.
        This protected participant privacy while still allowing meaningful instructional
        improvement. This ethical approach prepares me to responsibly manage user data in real-world IT environments where trust and compliance are critical.
    </p>

<section id="task3">
    <h2>Task 3 – Spiritual–Professional Integration Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Reflective activities this week, including attending the temple, reinforced how
        spiritual principles shape professional behavior. I gained clarity that ethical
        leadership in IT requires patience, humility, and accountability—not just
        technical skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        This understanding changed how I approach system design and decision-making.
        Rather than prioritizing speed or complexity, I now emphasize clarity, inclusion,
        and service. My spiritual development and professional growth are now
        intentionally aligned.
