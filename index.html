<section>
    <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This portfolio documents my spiritual development,
        professional growth, ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout my
        studies at Ensign College. My goal is to integrate technical excellence with
        faith-based principles, ethical leadership, and service-oriented decision-making
        in preparation for a career in information technology.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership, and ethical decision-making rather than waiting to be compelled (Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28).</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, accountability, transparency, and ethical stewardship in all professional and technical work.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology as a tool to uplift others, reduce barriers, and create meaningful, people-centered solutions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- TASK 1 -->
<section>
    <h2>Task 1 – Spiritual Portfolio Enhancement</h2>

    <h3>Christlike Attributes and Personal Warning Signs</h3>
    <p>
        My spiritual growth has been shaped by the principle of personal agency.
        Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose
        and responsibility. This principle has guided how I approach learning,
        leadership, and accountability in both academic and professional settings.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I reflected on my development, I identified personal warning signs that could
        hinder Christlike behavior, including impatience when projects move slowly and
        pride when technical solutions come easily. Recognizing these warning signs has
        allowed me to intentionally realign my behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        When impatience arises, I now slow my pace, listen actively, and refocus on service
        rather than efficiency. When pride appears, I deliberately seek feedback and
        collaboration to remain humble and teachable. These strategies have directly
        influenced how I designed my portfolio—prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and
        user experience over technical complexity.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- TASK 2 -->
<section>
    <h2>Task 2 – Professional Growth: Usability Testing & Design Enhancements</h2>

    <h3>Usability Testing Report</h3>
    <p>
        I conducted usability testing by reviewing my portfolio across multiple devices
        (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and inviting peer feedback. Testers reported
        difficulty locating key sections and noted readability issues related to contrast
        and layout density.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on this feedback, I implemented section anchors, simplified navigation,
        increased color contrast, added captions to images, and ensured responsive design
        for smaller screens. These enhancements significantly improved accessibility,
        reduced cognitive load, and allowed users to locate required content more
        efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemma Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        The ethical dilemma addressed in this portfolio involved balancing participant
        progress tracking with privacy and dignity. While data collection can improve
        instruction, excessive personal data compromises trust and agency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Guided by honesty, responsibility, transparency, and stewardship, I adopted an
        alternative approach using anonymized progress metrics and voluntary feedback.
        This approach protected participant privacy while still allowing instructional
        improvement. In future IT roles, I will apply this same ethical framework when
        handling user data and system monitoring.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- TASK 3 -->
<section>
    <h2>Task 3 – Spiritual–Professional Integration Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Reflective activities this week, including attending the temple, reinforced how
        spiritual principles shape professional behavior. I gained clarity that ethical
        leadership in IT requires patience, humility, and accountability—not just technical
        skill.
    </p>

    <p>
        This insight changed how I approach system design and decision-making. Rather than
        prioritizing speed or complexity, I now emphasize clarity, inclusion, and service.
        My professional growth and spiritual development are no longer separate paths but
        mutually reinforcing aspects of my identity as an IT professional.
