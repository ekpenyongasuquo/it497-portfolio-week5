  <h1>IT 497 – Spiritual Progression & Professional Growth Portfolio</h1>
  <p><strong>Ekpenyong Mfon</strong></p>

  <!-- Portfolio Introduction -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Portfolio Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my IT 497 portfolio. This site documents my spiritual development, professional growth, ethical understanding, and reflective learning throughout my studies at Ensign College. My goal is to integrate technical excellence with faith-based principles, ethical leadership, and service-oriented decision-making.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Guiding Principles -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agency:</strong> I take proactive responsibility for learning, leadership, and ethical decision-making. I strive to act intentionally rather than waiting to be compelled.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I commit to honesty, transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship in all technical and professional work.</li>
      <li><strong>Service:</strong> I use technology to uplift others, solve meaningful problems, and contribute positively to individuals and communities.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Spiritual Progression Portfolio -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio – Expansion & Deepening</h2>
    <p>My spiritual development has been shaped by the principle of personal agency. Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches that individuals should act with purpose rather than waiting to be compelled. This principle has influenced how I approach learning, leadership, and accountability in both academic and professional settings.</p>
    <p>As I have progressed academically and professionally, I have learned that spiritual growth is not passive. It requires deliberate choices, integrity, and a willingness to serve others. I actively strive to align my technical work with Christlike attributes such as patience, honesty, humility, compassion, and stewardship.</p>

  <!-- Professional Resume -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Professional Résumé (Summary)</h2>
    <p>IT student with hands-on experience in system configuration, accessibility optimization, instructional design, ethical data handling, and user-centered technology solutions. Skilled in documentation, data tracking, network configuration, and service-oriented IT implementation. My career goal is to pursue roles in cybersecurity or systems administration where ethical responsibility, security, and service are central to professional practice.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Professional Growth Portfolio -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Professional Growth Portfolio – Project Integration</h2>
    <h3>Primary Project: Community Computer Lab for the Elderly</h3>
    <p>This project was designed to reduce the digital divide among elderly individuals by creating a safe, supportive environment where seniors could learn essential computer skills and reconnect with family members through technology.</p>
    <p>Professionally, this project strengthened my skills in system configuration, accessibility optimization, instructional design, troubleshooting, and data-informed decision-making. Spiritually, it reinforced the importance of empathy, patience, service, and stewardship in technology leadership.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SQL Data Analysis Project: Applied principles of data integrity, accountability, and ethical stewardship while analyzing datasets and documenting findings accurately.</li>
      <li>Network Configuration Labs: Implemented VLANs, access controls, and routing configurations while practicing disciplined documentation and ethical access management.</li>
      <li>Cloud & Systems Projects: Focused on secure configurations, scalability, and responsible resource management aligned with ethical IT standards.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Ethical Dilemma -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis – Alternative Approach</h2>
    <p>The ethical dilemma involved balancing the need to track participant progress with the responsibility to protect privacy and dignity. Excessive personal data posed risks to trust and participant agency.</p>
    <p>The ethical principles guiding my decision included honesty, responsibility, respect for privacy, transparency, and stewardship of information. Rather than collecting detailed personal data, I implemented an alternative approach using anonymized progress metrics and voluntary feedback.</p>
    <p>This alternative resulted in better outcomes: participants felt respected and secure, trust increased, and the program retained sufficient data to improve instruction without compromising ethical standards.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project Refinement -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>IT Project: Refinement and Ethical Integration – Project Refinement Record</h2>
    <p>Initially, the project functioned as general technical support. Participant anxiety, limited hardware capabilities, and inconsistent learning outcomes revealed the need for refinement.</p>
    <p>I transitioned the project into a structured instructional design model. Lessons were broken into small, achievable goals to reduce anxiety and increase confidence. Accessibility settings were configured for low vision and limited dexterity, and older hardware was optimized for performance.</p>
    <p>Ethical considerations were integrated by treating participant data as a form of stewardship. Progress tracking was limited to essential anonymized metrics using Excel and Power BI. These refinements increased participant engagement, confidence, and learning consistency while maintaining ethical responsibility.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Video Reflection -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Video Reflection Script</h2>
    <p>In my video reflection, I explain how my spiritual beliefs influence my professional growth. I discuss how agency, integrity, and service guide my decision-making in IT environments. This project demonstrates how technical skills can be used to uplift others while maintaining ethical responsibility.</p>
    <p>Through refining this project, I learned that effective technology leadership requires both competence and compassion. Aligning professional work with spiritual principles has strengthened my confidence, accountability, and sense of purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Peer Review -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>I completed the assigned peer review by providing comprehensive, constructive, and actionable feedback addressing both technical quality and ethical integration.</p>

    <h3>Peer Review Evaluation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Technical Skills: Strong accessibility configuration, data tracking, and user-focused design.</li>
      <li>Ethical Integration: Clear emphasis on privacy, stewardship, transparency, and participant trust.</li>
      <li>Actionable Feedback: Recommended improved scalability planning, clearer documentation, and expanded evaluation metrics.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Week 5 Integration, Reflection, and Design Enhancement -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Week 5 – Integration, Reflection, and Design Enhancement</h2>
    <h3>Christlike Attributes & Personal Warning Signs</h3>
    <p>I reflected on integrating Christlike attributes into my daily life and professional practice. Recognizing moments of impatience or pride, I developed strategies to realign my behavior with principles of humility, patience, and service. These reflections guided refinements to my portfolio and professional growth practices.</p>

    <h3>Usability Testing & Design Enhancements</h3>
    <p>I conducted usability testing to identify navigation challenges and accessibility limitations. Enhancements included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved menu navigation and section anchors for easy access.</li>
      <li>Ensured responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.</li>
      <li>Added captions for images and improved color contrast for readability.</li>
      <li>Streamlined layout for better user experience and visual hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemma Reflection</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on the Week 2 dilemma, I explored balancing data tracking with privacy. I adopted anonymized metrics and voluntary feedback to maintain ethical standards. In future IT roles, I will continue to evaluate data collection practices carefully, prioritizing user dignity, trust, and agency.</p>

    <h3>Spiritual–Professional Integration Reflection</h3>
    <p>This week’s reflective activities, including attending the temple, helped me see how spiritual principles directly inform professional choices. Service, integrity, and stewardship are integrated into both project leadership and technical decision-making, creating a cohesive approach to ethical, faith-based IT practice.</p>
